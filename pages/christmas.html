            Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25
            as
            a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the
            Christian liturgical year, it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the
            Nativity
            Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and
            culminates
            on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by
            a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of
            the holiday season surrounding it. <br><br>
            圣诞节是一年一度的纪念耶稣基督诞生的节日，一般在12月25日，是世界各地数十亿人的宗教和文化庆祝活动。这是基督教礼仪年的中心节日，它紧随降临节（开始于四个星期天之前）或圣诞斋戒，并开启了圣诞季，在西方历史上持续十二天，并在第十二夜达到高潮。圣诞节是许多国家的公共假日，大多数基督徒在宗教上庆祝，许多非基督徒也在文化上庆祝，并形成了围绕它的假日季节的一个组成部分。

                I'm hiding from you<br>
                And your soul of ice<br>
                My god, I thought you were someone to rely on<br>
                Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on<br>
                <br>
                A face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br>
                A man under cover, but you tore me apart<br>
                Now I've found a real love. You'll never fool me again<br>
                <br>
                Last Christmas<br>
                I gave you my heart<br>
                But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                This year<br>
                To save me from tears<br>
                I'll give it to someone special<br>
                <br>
                Last Christmas<br>
                I gave you my heart<br>
                But the very next day you gave it away<br>

                A face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br>
                I gave you my heart<br>
                A man under cover, but you tore him apart<br>
                Maybe next year I'll give it to someone—<br>
                I'll give it to someone special<br>
                <br>
                Special<br>
                Someone<br>
                Someone<br>
                I'll give it to someone—<br>
                I'll give it to someone special<br>
                <br>
                Who give me something in return<br>
                I'll give it to someone—<br>
                Hold my heart and watch it burn<br>
                I'll give it to someone—<br>
                <br>
                I'll give it to someone—<br>
                I'll give it to someone special<br>
                <br>
                I thought you were here to stay<br>
                How could you love me for a day<br>
                I thought you were someone special<br>
                <br>
                Gave you my heart<br>
                <br>
                I'll give it to someone—<br>
                I'll give it to someone—<br>
                <br>
                Last Christmas<br>
                I gave you my heart<br>
                You gave it away<br>
                <br>
                I'll give it to someone—<br>

                Santa, tell me if you're really there<br>
                Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here<br>

                <br>
                Feeling Christmas all around<br>
                And I'm tryna play it cool<br>
                But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room<br>
                "Let It Snow" is blasting out<br>
                But I won't get in the mood<br>
                I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know<br>
                It's true love that he thinks of<br>
                So next Christmas<br>
                I'm not all alone, boy<br>

                I've been down this road before<br>
                Fell in love on Christmas night<br>
                But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side<br>
                Now I need someone to hold<br>
                Be my fire in the cold<br>
                But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling<br>
                Or if it's true love that he thinks of<br>
                So next Christmas<br>
                I'm not all alone, boy<br>

                Next year<br>
                <br>
                Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh<br>
                On the 25th by the fireplace, oh-oh-oh<br>
                But I don't want a new broken heart<br>
                This year I've got to be smart<br>

            今年的圣诞SNL真的太赞了😭Kate主持，monologue Rudolph和Kristen居然回来了，还有相当地狱的交换段子，碧梨的《Have Yourself A Merry Little
            Christmas》太好听了。

            我印象中的几次圣诞：<br>第一次是大概一年级吧，住在爷爷奶奶家，然后平安夜醒来之后爸爸让我找礼物。他说，礼物藏在这个房间的某个角落，你需要找到它。过了一会我找到了，是一盒子饼干。那个盒子还挺大的，比较高，然后是圆口的，尽管能记起这些细节但还是想不起来牌子是啥。
            <br>第二次是在二年级，我们小学给每个人发了一个苹果。很正式的！那个苹果是装在一个漂亮的小盒子里的，以至于我一直不舍得吃。
            <br>后来，懂的都懂，都没啦😅。
            <br>上了高一终于才听到圣诞神曲《All I Want For Christmas Is
            You》。相见恨晚啊！除了中国《恭喜发财》的喜庆欢快，歌曲的旋律真的给人一种暖心的感觉，圣诞节的团聚，相恋，愿望，好像都像小女孩火柴里的世界，成真了。我给爸爸听他也说这比《恭喜发财》好多了。
            <br>如果你去年这个时候来过这个网站，你应该还记得当时的圣诞庆祝是我在主页放了个小盒子，里面有牛姐牌播放器（bushi
            <br>那今年就更隆重了，你看，都单弄一个网页出来给圣诞啦。
